      <p>
        I love learning, and teaching what I already know. Iâ€™m a resourceful
        software developer excited by building pragmatic features that enrich
        and streamline user experience. When I'm not attending hackathons or
        teaching other community members how to code, I'm on a bike, a mountain,
        an airplane, or buried in a good book.
