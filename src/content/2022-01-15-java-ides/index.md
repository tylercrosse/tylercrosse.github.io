## Why I'm learning Java in 2022

- I have been studying Java to broaden my horizons as a software developer
- motivations - Master's Degree in CS, different types of work, common foundation, exposure to different techniques, etc.
- courses taken - CS1A, CS1B, CS61B, etc.
- Java lends itself well for a course on data structures. It is low level enough to put a focus on primitives. I don't have to worry about pointers or memory allocation.

- Getting started with IntelliJ has been confusing
- I can't get Eclipse to install.
- VSCode has been a breeze.

* What's an IML?
* Ant vs. Gradle vs. Maven ?? I just want to write code!
* Spring vs. Quarkus vs. MicroProfile

* Jar vs. class vs. classpath vs. module

* Using an IDE feels pretty restrictive
* IDE has nice support of debugging, & testing. I can even visualize the pointers between objects while stepping through the debugger execution.
* I miss being able to pass functions around
