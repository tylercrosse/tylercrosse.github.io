There is always more to learn. I have wanted to redo my personal site for a long time. One of the things that has prevented me is an unwillingness to accept that I am not as skilled or as knowledgeable as I would like to be. The irony is, the best way to become more knowledgeable is admit what you don't know and work on it.
