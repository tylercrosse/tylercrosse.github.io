This project has started with some simple goals.

- Practice Typescript, and Gatsby.
- Try out some new tools like tailwindcss.
- Re-do my portfolio site.
- Start blogging.

Gatsby is a nice choice for a blog. It makes it easy to ingest data from a variety of sources and easily feed it into react templates. The finished product it produces is fast and it's plugin architecture makes it easy to get off the ground. I spent nearly two years working on a Gatsby app I created while I worked at Rosetta Stone. It powered all of the companies B2B marketing efforts and significantly improved the companies ability track leads and convert them. Since then Gatsby as a framework has continued to evolve. It's added a ton of big features like themes and starters.

The initial phase of my work is focused on reaching parity with my existing site. The primary purpose of my portfolio site is professional. One of the things I do when I'm vetting candidates as part of my interview process is to look at their personal site, the projects listed on there, and quickly look through their github. It falls firmly in the 'nice to have' category. Having no site is worse than having a bad site, and having a superb one certainly bolsters a candidates chances but isn't a surrogate for the rest of the interview process.
